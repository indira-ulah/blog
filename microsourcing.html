                    On June 11, 2025, we, the BSCS students from WMSU, visited MicroSourcing in Quezon City. This trip was organized to show us how tech companies work and what jobs are out there in the IT-BPM world.

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Ms. Heidee Enriquez, the CEO, welcomed us. She talked about how important digital skills, being able to adapt, and always learning are for today's jobs. She told us to be curious and use these visits to see how our school lessons fit into real work.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We then toured their modern office, seeing how their cool setup helps people work well and feel good. MicroSourcing also cares a lot about helping Filipino professionals grow, offering flexible work and career programs.

                    My visit to MicroSourcing was super helpful! It really showed me the ins and outs of how a big outsourcing company runs. As a Frontend Developer and UI Designer, I noticed how their office design and digital tools help people work together smoothly, even when they're working for clients far away.

                    The LinkedIn workshop was a big highlight for me. We learned how to make our LinkedIn profiles strong, connect with people in the industry, and use the platform to find internships and jobs. This part of the trip made me feel much more ready to build my professional brand online and find future opportunities.
