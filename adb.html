                    On June 11, 2025, we, the BSCS students from WMSU, visited the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Mandaluyong City. This trip was organized with help from CXC and IBPAP, who are important partners in connecting schools with the tech industry.

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We started with a tour of the ADB Library and History Gallery, where we saw how ADB has helped countries in Asia and the Pacific grow. Then, we went to the Function Hall, where important meetings happen. We learned that ADB helps countries by giving loans, offering advice, and supporting projects that make life better for people.

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We also learned about CXC, a company that helps businesses find and manage workers. They explained how they help with hiring and making sure rules are followed.
