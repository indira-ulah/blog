                    On June 10, 2025, we, the BSCS students from WMSU, had a very interesting visit to Kollab in Mandaluyong City. This trip was all about learning how tech companies work in the real world.

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Ralph Vincent Regalado, Kollabâ€™s Chief Scientist, welcomed us and told us about their vision for using tech to help people work together better. Jazmine Calma, a Senior QA Engineer, talked about why a good workplace culture is important. Toni-Jan Keith Monserrat, a Senior Principal AI Engineer, showed us how AI is used in real life, like in farming, customer service, and health. Miguel Siriban, a UI/UX Designer, gave us tips on how to make a great portfolio to get hired.

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We also had a lively Q&A session where we asked about getting jobs and internships in tech. The speakers shared their own career stories and told us to keep learning and stay curious.

                    Visiting Kollab was a great experience. I really liked learning about how AI is used in practical ways, not just in theory. As a Frontend Developer and UI Designer, Miguel Siriban's tips on building a portfolio were super helpful.

                    It showed me that it's important to not only have technical skills but also be able to show your creativity and how you think. The whole visit made me feel more ready and excited for my future in the tech world.
