                    On June 10, 2025, we, the BSCS students from WMSU, visited Teleperformance (TP) Philippines at SM Aura Office in Taguig City. This trip was exciting because TP is a big global company that helps businesses with customer services.

                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Ms. Beatrice Grace Bonjibod, a Brand Marketing Specialist, welcomed us. She explained that TP does more than just phone calls; they use new tech and focus on people to offer many services. She also shared that over half of their workers are women, which shows they care about equality.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    We also learned that "soft skills" like talking well, working with others, being understanding, and flexible are very important for any job. After the talk, we toured TPâ€™s Innovation and Solutions Hub, where we saw cool new tech like automation and data analysis that makes business work better.

                    My visit to Teleperformance was really eye-opening. I saw how much technology is used in customer service, not just simple call centers. As a future tech professional, it was cool to see how they use automation and data to make things run smoothly.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                    The focus on soft skills also stuck with me. It's not just about coding; it's about being a good communicator and team player. This trip showed me how important it is to have both tech skills and people skills in the real world.
